## Generates ideas for games by mixing popular genres and steam tags.

Basically I combined two lists, recent steam tags and popular steam game genres, so we randomize two game genres and one steam tag and after that it's all up to our imagination, I believe that with this approach we can get thinking of some unusual or innovative game ideas by getting unusual combinations. Sometimes you will get total trash obviously, but I suggest to think about it a little, maybe something magical can come from there.

P.S: Would appreciate any collaborationn, suggestions for mprovements or other ideas on how to combine lists to generate ideas.
